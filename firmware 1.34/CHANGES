  low value B-E resistor. Those are detected as dual diodes. The B-E resistor
  will be shown to signal that special case.

  concerned probe pin and the remaining voltage are displayed. That will help
  to detect a too low value for CAP_DISCHARGED.
- Added the capability to set error types

v1.05m 2012-11
- Moved LargeCap_table[] and SmallCap_table[] from EEPROM to flash to reduce
  EEPROM usage. The size for a German firmware exceeded the 512 bytes of an
  ATmega168s EEPROM.
